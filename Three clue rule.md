### **Summary of the "Three Clue Rule" (2008)**  

**Problem:** Mystery scenarios in RPGs often fail because players miss key clues, misinterpret evidence, or get stuck, leading to frustration. Unlike fictional detectives like Sherlock Holmes, players aren’t guaranteed to notice or correctly analyze every detail.  

**Solution – The Three Clue Rule:**  
For any conclusion the players need to reach, provide **at least three clues**. This ensures redundancy:  
- Players might miss the first clue, ignore the second, or misinterpret the third.  
- Even if they fail to grasp some clues, at least one should guide them forward.  
- Extra clues reinforce deductions, making the mystery feel more immersive (like Holmes piecing together multiple pieces of evidence).  

**Key Principles:**  
1. **No Exceptions:** Even "obvious" clues can be missed—always include backups.  
2. **Permissive Clue-Finding:** Reward creative player ideas beyond pre-planned clues. Treat prep as a safety net, not a constraint.  
3. **Proactive Clues:** If players stall, introduce active events (e.g., a new murder, a threat from the villain) to provide fresh leads.  
4. **Avoid Red Herrings:** Players often fixate on wrong suspects naturally; adding deliberate misdirection risks derailing the game.  
5. **Chokepoints Require Redundancy:** For essential plot points (e.g., finding a secret door), ensure multiple solutions (e.g., a search check, a note, or an enemy using the door).  

**Design Tips:**  
- List all key conclusions and assign multiple clues to each.  
- Track which clues players find and adjust dynamically if they’re stuck.  
- Embrace player ingenuity—unexpected solutions can be more fun than pre-written ones.  

**Final Advice:**  
Mystery scenarios thrive on flexibility. By providing multiple paths to success and being open to player-driven discoveries, GMs can avoid dead-ends and create engaging, Holmesian investigations.  

**Rule to Remember:**  
*For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues.*
