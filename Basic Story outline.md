### Opening Scene
- Action Intro
- Coccolona compels the team to investigate, and provides them with two names/locations to investigate.
- (_possibly_) Someone is following. (this is a plot point that they would need to discover. Won't be given to them or neccessary for completion.)
### First Investigation
- Team investigates one or both places
- - Have a "red cord" clue (Make sure there are at least 3 of these to find or three ways to discover)
- - Add in some more "loose pins", clues that allow for them to sus out a bit more about story
### Talk to the dockmaster
- Clues lead the team to the dockmaster who both of the other victims were connected too.
### Find hidden compartment
- Need clues that will make this feasible.
- Compartment contains _the artifact_ which it's then revealed the baddies were after the whole time, and have used the team to find.
