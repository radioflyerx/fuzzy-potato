# RPG Setting: Space Train Concept


  

## Premise

-   In Earth’s near future, a **massive space vessel** appears intermittently:
-   Arrives every few years, stays for a week, then disappears.
-   Returns on a predictable schedule.
-   Humans discover the vessel can **"pull" objects** attached to it.
-   Over **hundreds of years**, it evolves into a **giant space train** with countless attached modules ("cars").

  

## The Train’s Structure

-   **Engine**: A mile-wide (or larger) spaceship of ancient/origin unknown.
-   **Cars**:  Ragtag conglomerations of ships, cargo containers, and makeshift additions.
-   New additions are glued to the **back**; older sections near the front resemble original ships.
-   Cars are **miles wide/tall** but shrink in size toward the rear.
-   **No physical connections**: Cars float ~0.25 miles apart, held by an **engine-generated field**.
-   **Irreversible attachment**: Anything added becomes permanent—no retrieving ships or cargo.

  

## Scale & Civilization

-   **Massive**: Up to **1,000 miles long**, hundreds of cars.
-   - **Functions like a nation-state**:
-   - **No war allowed** between cars.
-   - **Communist base layer**: Guaranteed shelter, food, and water for all.
-   - **Capitalist top layer**: Old West-style free-market economy.
-   - **Population**: Humans live aboard permanently AND colonize habitable worlds the train passes.

  

## Communication Rules

 -   **No radio/digital signals**: All communication is either:

 -   Hardlined (physical connections).
 
 -   Via "**broad sheets**" (recyclable newspaper-like bulletins).

 - Delivery by courier.

-   Purpose: The train/ship enforces this—possibly to control information or prevent conflict.

  

## Train’s Role

-   **Transport**: Passengers, cargo, and news between worlds.
-   **Colonization**: Drops settlers on uninhabited planets; over centuries, these become populated.
-   **Economy**: Later, purpose-built cargo containers are added (not just scrapped ships).

  

## Aesthetic & Tone

-   **Old West meets spacefaring**: Lawless capitalism atop a structured, communal foundation.
-   - **Eclectic visuals**: Front cars look like advanced ships; rear cars are patchwork junk.

  

## Gameplay Hooks

-   **Politics**: Factions/cars vying for power within the train’s rules.
-   **Mystery**: Origin/control of the engine, why it bans certain tech.
-   **Survival**: Life on the fringe (back cars) vs. established front sections.
-   **Exploration**: New worlds, train car "dungeons," or salvaging detached modules.
