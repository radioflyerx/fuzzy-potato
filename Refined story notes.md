  - **Bowtrain (Boward)**: Wealthy, elite residences (front).  
  - **Middletrain**: Heart of society, where most of the story unfolds.  
  - **Sterntrain (Downstern)**: Industrial, cargo, and transient passengers (rear).

## **Core Mystery & Plot**  
### **Genre & Tone**  
- **Primary**: Mystery with action-driven pacing.  
- **Secondary**: Supernatural/mystique (*Stranger Things*-like eeriness).  
- **Vibe**: Wild West lawlessness—justice is slow, power is local.  

### **Inciting Incident**  
- **Option 1**: Missing children (abductions for sinister purposes).  
- **Option 2**: Serial killings sparking factional tensions.  
  - **Chosen Path**: Murders escalate toward gang war; players must solve them before the train "cleanses" those involved.  

### **Investigation Team**  
A rag-tag group with conflicting motives:  
1. **The Chemist** (Clever +3)  
   - Discredited university researcher (Carrington Middletrain University).  
   - Brilliant but labeled "paranoid"—is she uncovering truth or losing it?  
2. **The Brute** (Forceful +3)  
   - Mafia enforcer who dreams of being a cook.  
   - Kept in the organization via manipulation.  
   - Has a dog, *Sherlock*, and underground connections.  
3. **The Tea House Spy** (Sneaky +3)  
   - Former "fancy lady" running a tea lounge as a spy network front.  
   - Debt collectors closing in; relies on gossip and clockwork cat *Crick*.  

### **Antagonists & Conflict**  
- **Local Factions**:  
  - **La Mano Dolce**: "Good" Italian mafia (maintains order, opposes chaos).  
  - **Rival Gang**: Suspected of killings; tensions risk all-out war.  
- **True Villain**:  
  - A **larger conspiracy** (possibly university-backed) seeking a **train artifact**.  
  - Murders are a smokescreen for their goals.

## **Campaign Structure**  
### **Opening Scene (In Medias Res)**  
- **Where**: Whimsy Wren’s Tea Shop (Car 81).  
- **Action Trigger**: Explosion/kidnapping attempt—unusually brazen for the stealthy villains.  
  - Fight/chase ensues in a nearby park; villains escape with victim.  
- **Aftermath**: Hired by **Cocolona** (mafia boss) to investigate.  

### **Act 1: The Investigation**  
- **Leads**:  
  - **Safe Lead**: Local clue (e.g., university records)—may involve being tailed.  
  - **Risky Lead**: Rival gang territory—could trigger confrontation.  
- **Clues Point To**: The **Dockmaster** (key info-holder in Sterntrain).  

### **Act 2: Unraveling the Conspiracy**  
- **Discovery**: Killings tied to a **hidden artifact** in Car 81.  
- **Twist**: The real enemy is an external force manipulating factions.  

### **Finale: Showdown & Sequel Hook**  
- **Location**: Hidden compartment in Car 81.  
- **Outcome**:  
  - Artifact stolen, but killers exposed.  
  - Conspiracy revealed as larger threat (setup for future arcs).  

---

## **Themes & Motivations**  
- **Law in Chaos**: Mafia keeps order; their stability is threatened.  
- **Information as Power**: Spy networks vs. brute force vs. intellect.  
- **Identity & Belonging**: Train sections define social status (e.g., "Bowtrain elitism").  

---

## **Open Questions**  
- Exact nature of the **artifact** (weapon? Fuel source?).  Z.O.E.D. (zone of exclusion device)
- How the rival gang reacts to investigators.  
- Supernatural elements: Are the killers enhanced? Is the train alive?
